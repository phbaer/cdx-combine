# cdx-combine
Combine CycloneDX SBOM files into one consolidated CycloneDX SBOM. The individual SBOM contents are grouped under their respective project.

This is useful if a product is made up of several independent projects. The product SBOM can then be handled as a consolidated single source that still exhibits its subcomponents.
